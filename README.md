# BizGecko
Gecko Codes for BizHawk.

### Usage

File locations:
```
Bizhawk/
  Lua/
    BizGecko.lua
    BizGecko/
      cheats.lua
      codehandler.lua
      docs.lua
```

Have the Majora's Mask ROM loaded then run the `BizGecko.lua` script.
A form window will be created.

All of the codes are stored in the `cheats.lua` script by ROM Hash.
If there are codes for the game when BizGecko is opened they will be loaded.

### Info

This was an old project I was working on since BizHawk doesn't have any GameShark or Gecko Codes built into it.
This could really use some fixing and added codes for games.
